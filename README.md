# Boss Grinder

The game we wanted to create was a Top Down wave shooter, where you and your little dragon fight bosses to progress through the waves. You will have different abilities that let you throw knives and fireballs, and dash to escape an attack. After each cleared wave you will get loot. The loot consists of boosts and health regen potions. The game will have a variety of different bosses with various stats to differentiate them and make the battles more intense.
